### Code of Conduct
It's a good idea to have a Code of Conduct to hold 
your community members accountable to and create a 
safe and inclusive space for everyone. This helps 
establish clear expectations on how community 
members should behave respectfully in their 
interactions with each other and serves as a 
reference for fair arbitration when the need 
arises.

You can base your Code of Conduct off of similar 
projects' ones or use the [Contributor 
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) 
as a starting point, tailoring it to your 
community's specific needs. Larger projects should 
have an impartial committee dedicated to handling 
Code of Conduct violations, and a method for 
community members to privately raise issues to 
them.

### Assume positive intent and acknowledge 
negative impact
Many interpersonal conflicts stem from simple 
misunderstandings. It is important to assume 
positive intent and acknowledge negative impact to 
prevent further escalation of the situation. 
Remind everyone that they share the same goals and 
try to find commonalities between each party's 
reasonings. Validate that perhaps the offending 
party meant no malice while also validating the 
ways that the offended party was hurt.

### When to step in
Once discussions begin to get heated, with 
misunderstandings and accusations getting thrown 
in, immediate resolution can be difficult. At this point, 
project leaders should consider stepping in, asking 
involved parties to cool off, 
and try to find a way for them to understand each 
other.

When the Code of Conduct is violated, you should 
take disciplinary action as detailed therein and 
communicate to the offending party what they did 
wrong and why. Assure the offended party that you 
are taking the offense seriously and detail what 
actions you took to remedy the situation, as well 
as taking into account what their desired outcome 
is.

Do not wait for a report to take action on a Code 
of Conduct violation, it's best to address obvious 
breaches of the Code in a timely manner to 
demonstrate that it is important and a priority of 
your project. Staying proactive helps to cultivate 
a positive and healthy community dynamic.
