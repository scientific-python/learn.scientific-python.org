As a maintainer, you will be the first point of 
contact for new community members. It is important 
to embody a positive and helpful force for the 
health of your community.

### Be welcoming
Always behave in a manner that is polite, patient, and understanding. 
Many contributors are acting on their own time so 
try to create an environment that is energizing, 
not draining.

Use language to show that you are excited and 
grateful about their contributions to the project. 
Avoid saying things that could be construed as 
meaning otherwise or being too short.

Many first-time contributors are intimidated and 
nervous about making mistakes, so keep in mind for 
both you and them that mistakes are natural and 
part of the learning process. Assure and empower 
them with your help and mentorship so that they 
feel supported and comfortable contributing to the 
project.

### Provide resources, not solutions
While some level of shepherding is needed, be 
careful not to micro-manage contributors, as it 
hinders the learning process and can be 
frustrating for both parties. First offer guidance 
before using more hands-on approaches.

For tasks that may be too advanced or daunting for 
a first-time contributor, such as comprehensive 
testing, benchmarking, or doc-building, offer to 
handle that part or to lend your support while 
they try it themselves.

Avoid excessive nitpicking as requesting constant 
small changes can be discouraging to a new 
contributor. Instead, you can make a follow-up PR 
after the merge to fix these or use an opinionated 
formatter, such as 
[`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), to handle 
most style-related nitpicks.

### Recognize contributions
Remember that contributions are a good thing that 
should be celebrated and encouraged. Communicate 
your appreciation for the work your community 
members are doing and connect the impact their 
contributions have to your project's goals and how 
it will help many others.

By providing a positive contributing experience, 
you can create a positive feedback loop where 
community members enjoy and want to continue their 
amazing contributions to your project!
