- Organizing sprints
  - Organising sprints are an excellent way to invite new collaborators, solve issues, gather contributions and broaden the project community. Some helpful tips for organising a sprint efficiently:
    - Have a list of issues from the issue tracker that can be worked on. The issues should have a mix of code (bugs, features, fixes) and no-code (documentation) tasks so that they can accommodate a diverse set of participants
- Handling a storm of new contributors during peak season (GSoC, Outreachy, GSOD etc.)
