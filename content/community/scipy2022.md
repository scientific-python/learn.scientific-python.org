Hello everyone, I'm Juanita. Today I want to show you our experience at the SciPy conference 2022.

SciPy 2022 was the 21st annual Scientific Computing with Python conference held in Austin, Texas from July 11 to July 17, 2022. Yearly, this conference brings together attendees from industry, academia, and government to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development.

Let's go!

This year the conference took place in the AT&T Hotel and Conference Center at the University of Texas campus in Austin.

The conference started with two days of tutorials that usually take place before the general conference. During these, participants get the chance to learn  about a specific topic in a hands-on manner. They are usually 4 hours long and can be beginner, intermediate or advanced level. There are two sessions of simultaneous tutorials (this year 7) which means you had a lot of topics to choose from, regardless of your experience level.

The conference officially started on Tuesday with a Welcome reception hosted by Enthought, the institutional sponsor of the conference. There we got the chance to meet many of the speakers, sponsors and attendees of the conference. We had great food and made new friends!

On Wednesday we went through the registration early in the morning and received our SciPy swag!

The conference kicked off with some Welcome announcements, the keynote speaker and the SciPy Tools plenary Session, where developers from each of the tools usually give short updates on their packages. These three sessions were held in the main room every day of the conference (from Wednesday to Friday).

Most of the other talks and sessions were held simustaneously with other two sessions in two other rooms so you only could attend one of them! The best play was to keep track of the SciPy schedule in order to figure out where to go next.

This year, the talks in sessions were divided according to their topic. Some of them included Earth, Ocean, Geo, Materials & Chemistry, Physics & Astronomy, Machine Learning and Data Life Cycle. There was also a mantainers track where maintainers of Scientific Python packages presented cool stuff about their tools or updates on new releases.

During the breaks, the conference center always offered amazing food, coffee and QUESO! We got the chance to visit the sponsor tables and learn about some of the most relevant companies supporting open source. Some of them had very cool swag to add to our SciPy bag. And of course this was the time to make new friends and meet amazing people from all around the world.

There was also a Job Fair and Poster Session during Wednesday night where companies from around the world were recruiting for new positions and developers were presenting their work in posters! This was a great way to know about people's works and learn about what the community is up to with Scientific Python. And if you were also interested, a great way to end up with some job options and very promising contacts.

The conference also had awesome Birds of a Feather sessions this year, meant for people to gather and discuss around shared interests. This is a really cool space to have conversations with other people that have similar thoughts, in order to build new ideas and create plans together around a specific topic. There were four of these sessions in total, splitted into two days, Thursday and Friday with at least four BOF's happening on different topics so, lots of options to get involved in interesting conversations!

One of the most interesting spaces of the conference this year was the Maintainers panel where some maintainers of the Scientific Python ecosystem gathered to asnwer questions from attendees of the conference regarding different topics. This was the perfect space to directly interact with the developers of some of the Scientific Python packages and learn everything about the ecoystem. Not every day you get the chance to talk to a developer of your favorite python library.

Evenings at SciPy were filled with all the cool stuff. Lighning talks this year were on fire! These are 5 minute talks that people register to give during the conference about any topic. Literally any topic: from funny packages like catplotlib meant to plot cat images, to talks about planning SciPy on Mars using an astrodynamics python package called Poliastro or even a SciPy song. People don't usually come prepared to give them before the conference, they just get ideas during it and plan these short talks on the fly and results can be really amazing and almost always very funny. This is the perfect opportunity to lose the stage frigt and try something new!

Almost every day after sessions at the conference were over, there was some other activity happening that included food for sure. This year we had the Annual Reception Sponsored by IBM, Data Drinks and Bites with Deepnote, Happy Hour by Mozilla, Taco Truck night and many other activities where we got to meet new friends and talk to people we have only ever interacted before on GitHub. After all, the best part of the conference is the community around it. Getting to meet the developers you have been working with for years or the maintainer of your favorite Scientific Python package is an opportunity that you can't miss.

The last two days of the conference Saturday and Sunday (not everyone stays for these), were the sprints where people work together with project maintainers on open-source projects. This is a great chance to submit your first PR in a Scientific Python project, you will get the help of an amazing group of people who are willing to teach and share their knowledge with the community. Sprints are an informal part of the conference, so if you are not interested in coding, you are welcome to just exchange ideas or get involved in conversations. A great output of a sprint can be a lasting connections with a developer you want to start working with or a PR on your favorite package.

The conference was a blast and at the end we got to go home with new knowledge, new ideas and new friends. The open source Scientific Python community is amazing and the SciPy conference makes it possible to share ideas and build knowledge together.

I hope to you see you at SciPy 2023 and we are very happy for you to join the Scientific Python community. 

Welcome to Scientific Python!
