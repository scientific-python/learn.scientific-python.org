## How to initiate a community meeting?

- Before starting the meeting, having a few items and discussion points in the
  agenda will help kick-start the meeting. These discussion points could be a
  mix of:
- Issues or PRs from the GitHub repositories which need attention
- Announcing any upcoming events/conferences to check if someone is going to
  attend them or is planning to
- Important updates:
  - These could be recent releases/new feature additions
  - Addition/changes in the maintainer/contributor team
  - Convergence of an ongoing discussion - a summary of how the community
    reached a decision
  - Anything important which needs to be brought up before the community
  - Let everyone know that the meeting is governed by a CoC

## Ice-breakers

- Ice-breakers are usually effective when the participants are not familiar with
  each other
- Apart from the general introduction, which is usually name and role, itâ€™s
  effective to add a fun question (generally non-technical) to ask around;
  these are:
  - Favourite song, movie, dish, sport, game, tourist spot etc.
  - If you could teach the world one thing, what would it be?
  - Whatâ€™s one interesting fact about yourself?

## How to address any critical issues in the project/community

- Sometimes, there are certain matter which needs to be brought up before the
  community for a more open and inclusive discussion
- This helps in taking into account various perspectives from the community and
  choosing a solution which is in the best interest of the community

## How to keep the conversation going?

- Occasionally, there are situations when the conversation during a community
  meeting dies, and it feels like youâ€™re in a graveyard ðŸª¦
  - Having a set up of backup discussion points can help remove the awkward
    silence
  - Going around in the audience to ask if they have something interesting to
    share with the community
    - What projects are they working on?
    - Something they learned which could be shared with the community
    - Asking around if the attendees need any help

## How to conclude the meeting successfully

- The meeting should end on a positive note - if there has been any heated
  discussion/arguments, try to conclude before the end. And generally, in the
  end, you should:
  - Conclude important points
  - Revise tabled items - which were supposed to be discussed but didnâ€™t get
    time
  - Tell them about the next meeting

## How to run office hours?

- Office hours are a great way to invite the community and answer their
  questions, guide them, help them understand any specific about your OSS
  project etc.
  - Usually, the structure of office hours is open, but there are certain tips
    which could make it run smoother; they are:
  - Greet and acknowledge every participant during the office hours
  - Try to answer at least 1 question from everyone
  - Maintain a document so that everyone can jot down their questions, so itâ€™s
    easier to go through them
  - Invite them to the community meetings for broader discussions

## How to take meeting notes?

- Every community meeting should have some form of public record which can be
  stored as an archive - taking meeting notes is one way to do it. There are
  several ways to take notes efficiently, which is helpful for the community
  - Record the essential things, decisions, and resolutions that were discussed
    during the meeting
  - Writing cues during the meeting and then converting them into proper
    sentences is a helpful thing to do when youâ€™re moderating/running the
    meeting
  - Try to have a TL;DR section at the top - this would help the reader to
    decide if they want to dive into the full notes or not

## Some tips for your meetings

- Make time for demos/showcases/presentation
  - The community members are always looking for exciting/innovative ways to use
    OSS projects in their workflow, and making time to showcase the work is a
    good element of a community meeting
    - The demos/showcases could be - how your project is used to solve a problem
      in a specific domain
- Make time for newcomers
  - New contributors or newcomers are the users who have the potential of
    becoming future maintainers and helping them in the initial phase is
    beneficial for both the project and the individual and is in the spirit of
    open-source
    - Having a dedicated time slot for the newcomers to help them
- Make community meetings accessible to the broader community
  - Take into account community members in different time zones, differently
    abled, unavailability etc.
  - Take notes and upload them to the website
  - Record the meeting
