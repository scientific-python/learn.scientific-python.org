Most packages use _continuous integration_ (CIs) to ensure that new code contributions don't break existing functionality.
CIs do things like run code style checks, run unit tests on different operating systems or different dependency versions, and build documentation websites.
Frequently, when you contribute bugfixes, new features, or documentation changes to a packages, one or more of the CIs will fail.
Below, we show how to figure out _why_ they failed, and what to do to fix them.
